# Umichanime.com

Created around 2010 using PHP and Adobe Dreamweaver as well as MySQL/PHPAdmin, this website was created by Michael Mark and Johnson Mark at the University of Michigan.  We aimed to create a history of the anime club as well as try to make the club more fun for everyone by giving them a platform to communicate, meet each other, as well as stay updated for the events while we were there at the club.

## Website Design

**Umichanime.edu** was a great way to showcase my skills as a website designer. It has been taken down since my brother and I left the university and continued under other domain, but we feel like we did a great job for the site, bringing more people together and had a lot more fun with the club that way.  We brought more people in for the infamous "Con Ja Nai" convention, AKA the convention that's not really a convention.
